# Changelog

All notable changes to `QueryPipeline` will be documented in this file.

## v1.0.2 - 2022-11-10

Instead of needing to put the name of the table, it is also possible to pass the model that the table will be used for.

Now is possible to do the follow:

```php
$query = $this->runPipeline($query, $data, [
    ILIKEQuery::class => [
        Question::class => [
            'type',
            'title',
            'description',
        ],
    ],

]);
